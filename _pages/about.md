I am a freelance scientist.

My favorite research topics include the effects of natural selection on the evolution of learning and cognition in social interactions, the evolution of plasticity, the behavioral and genetic adaptations to changing environments. I am also generally interested in evolutionary and stochastic game theory, and dynamical systems. For more information, please [click here](/research/).

I recently devoted some time and energy to research on the topic of [Covid-19](/covid19/).
