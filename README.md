# My website

This is the repositiry for my professional website where you can learn about my research and my scientific publications.

As advised by Github, I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate my website. I also use the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)


## Expected features

- French and Arabic versions of the site.
- Popular science section, where I explain in everyday language my research. There will be examples and applications of my findings in nature and society.
- Live/interactive simulations.
- Videos of simulations.
- Code for the simulations and numerical analyses found in my paper.
- A link to the Sagemath package for producing evolutionary diagrams (similar to Dynamo of Sandholm).
- A link to the R package for analyzing the learning dynamics in experimental games.
